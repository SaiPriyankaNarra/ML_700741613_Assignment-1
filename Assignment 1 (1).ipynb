classifier with K=3 on this dataset, we first need to calculate the distance between each test sample and each training sample. A common distance metric used in KNN is Euclidean distance, which is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared differences between the feature values of the two samples. Using this metric, we can calculate the distances between the test samples (f=6, 7, 10, 11) and the training samples (f=1, 2, 3, 6) as follows:\nTest Sample 1 (f=6): distance to Training Sample 1 (f=1) = sqrt((6-1)^2) = 5\ndistance to Training Sample 2 (f=2) = sqrt((6-2)^2) = 4\ndistance to Training Sample 3 (f=3) = sqrt((6-3)^2) = 3\ndistance to Training Sample 4 (f=6) = sqrt((6-6)^2) = 0\n\nTest Sample 2 (f=7): distance to Training Sample 1 (f=1) = sqrt((7-1)^2) = 6\ndistance to Training Sample 2 (f=2) = sqrt((7-2)^2) = 5\ndistance to Training Sample 3 (f=3) = sqrt((7-3)^2) = 4\ndistance to Training Sample 4 (f=6) = sqrt((7-6)^2) = 1\n\nTest Sample 3 (f=10): distance to Training Sample 1 (f=1) = sqrt((10-1)^2) = 9\ndistance to Training Sample 2 (f=2) = sqrt((10-2)^2) = 8\ndistance to Training Sample 3 (f=3) = sqrt((10-3)^2) = 7\ndistance to Training Sample 4 (f=6) = sqrt((10-6)^2) = 4\n\nTest Sample 4 (f=11): distance to Training Sample 1 (f=1) = sqrt((11-1)^2) = 10\ndistance to Training Sample 2 (f=2) = sqrt((11-2)^2) = 9\ndistance to Training Sample 3 (f=3) = sqrt((11-3)^2) = 8\ndistance to Training Sample 4 (f=6) = sqrt((11-6)^2) = 5\n\nNext, we sort the distances in ascending order and select the K (in this case, 3) closest training samples to each test sample. The class labels of these closest training samples are then used to predict the class label of the test sample. Using this process, the predicted outputs for the test samples would be as follows:\n\nTest Sample 1 (f=6):class label = 1 (based on the class labels of the closest 3 training samples: 1, 1, 1)\nTest Sample 2 (f=7):class label = 1 (based on the class labels of the closest 3 training samples: 1, 1, 1)\nTest Sample 3 (f=10):class label = 2 (based on the class labels of the closest 3 training samples: 2, 2, 2)\nTest Sample 4 (f=11):class label = 2 (based on the class labels of the closest 3 training samples: 2, 2, 2)\n    \n 2. To compute the confusion matrix, we first need to compare the predicted outputs for the test samples to their actual class labels. The confusion matrix is a table that shows the number of true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), and false negatives (FN) for a classification model. The confusion matrix for this KNN classifier with K=3 would be as follows:\n       | Predicted Class 1 | Predicted Class 2 |\n    Actual |-------------------|-------------------|\n    Class 1 | 2 | 0 |\n    Class 2 | 0 | 2 |\n\nOnce we have the confusion matrix, we can calculate various performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.\n\nAccuracy: (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN) = (2+2) / (2+2+0+0) = 1.0\nSensitivity (or recall): TP / (TP + FN) = 2 / (2 + 0) = 1.0\nSpecificity: TN / (TN + FP) = 2 / (2 + 0) = 1.0\nSo, the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values are 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 respectively.\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.15","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
